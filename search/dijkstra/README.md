Dijkstra's Algorithm
===

- Dijkstra's algorithm is used to calculate the shortest path for a weighted graph.
  - BFS is used to calculate the shortest path for a unweighted graph.
- Dijkstra's algorithm works well with positively weighted graph.
  - Use Bellman-Ford algorithm when there are negative weights.
- It works with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
